## 1. Purpose & Scope

jinja-lsp is one binary that speaks standard LSP over stdio. This spec is about the thin shims each editor needs to launch that binary and hand it configuration — nothing more.

That's the whole design: the server owns the logic, and an integration is just *how this editor finds and starts the server* plus *how this editor's settings reach it*. Because every editor uses the same stdio transport ([ADR-009](../decisions/ADR-009-stdio-only-transport.md)), the integrations differ only in packaging.

This spec covers:

- A **VS Code** extension — language client, activation events, settings schema, syntax highlighting.
- A **Zed** extension — a Rust crate that registers the grammar and the language server.
- A **Neovim** setup — a documented `nvim-lspconfig` block, no plugin to publish.
- A **generic LSP-client** recipe — the `InitializationOptions` schema, so any client configures the server without a config file.

## 2. Non-Goals / Out of Scope

- The server's capabilities and protocol conduct — owned by [E01-architecture](../foundations/E01-architecture.md).
- Config keys and their meaning (`templates`, `extras`, `hints`, `lint.*`, …) — owned by [E15-app-config](../foundations/E15-app-config.md). This spec only maps editor settings *onto* those keys.
- Building and publishing the artifacts (marketplace, releases) — owned by [F21-release-ci](F21-release-ci.md).
- Any non-stdio transport — there isn't one ([ADR-009](../decisions/ADR-009-stdio-only-transport.md)).

## 3. Background & Rationale

The Zed extension is a small `zed_extension_api` crate that declares the tree-sitter-jinja grammar and the jinja-lsp language server. Alongside it, jinja-lsp ships integrations for the editors developers actually use.

The guiding rule is that an integration must add *zero* analysis logic. It launches the binary, forwards settings, and gets out of the way. If an integration starts to "know things" about Jinja, that knowledge belongs in the server, not the shim.

Two config delivery paths exist and they layer. A project with a `jinja.toml` is configured by that file; the editor needs to supply nothing. On top of that file (or, with no file, on top of the zero-config defaults) the editor's LSP `InitializationOptions` are overlaid, overriding any key they set — so a user can keep a shared `jinja.toml` and still override a key from their editor. The `InitializationOptions` schema mirrors the config keys exactly. Same keys, two delivery mechanisms, file-then-overlay precedence ([E15](../foundations/E15-app-config.md) REQ-CFG-11) — see §5.5.

## 4. Concepts & Definitions

- **Language client** — the editor-side half of LSP that launches and talks to the server.
- **Activation event** — the VS Code trigger that loads the extension (e.g. opening a `.jinja` file).
- **`InitializationOptions`** — the JSON blob a client sends in the `initialize` request to configure a server without a config file. (Schema in §5.5.)
- **Config file** — `jinja.toml` or `pyproject.toml`'s `[tool.jinja]`. (Canonical definition in [glossary](../glossary.md).)
- **tmLanguage** — the TextMate grammar format VS Code uses for syntax highlighting.

## 5. Detailed Specification

### 5.1 Shared contract — stdio, every editor

Every integration launches the same binary the same way.

**REQ-EDIT-01 — All integrations launch `jinja-lsp lsp` over stdio.**

The server is invoked as `jinja-lsp lsp`; the client communicates over the process's stdin/stdout. There is no TCP/`--http` option to configure ([ADR-009](../decisions/ADR-009-stdio-only-transport.md)). An integration must let the user override the binary path (for a non-`PATH` install) but must default to discovering `jinja-lsp` on `PATH`.

**REQ-EDIT-02 — Configuration reaches the server one of two ways.**

A `jinja.toml` / `pyproject.toml` in the workspace (the server discovers it — [E15](../foundations/E15-app-config.md)) and/or the client's `InitializationOptions` (§5.5). When both are present, the file is the base and `InitializationOptions` override it per-key; keys the editor omits keep the file's values ([E15](../foundations/E15-app-config.md) REQ-CFG-11). With no file, the options overlay the zero-config defaults. No integration invents its own config format.

### 5.2 VS Code extension

A TypeScript extension that bundles a language client and a settings UI.

**REQ-EDIT-03 — Language client over stdio.**

The extension uses `vscode-languageclient` to spawn `jinja-lsp lsp` and pipe LSP over stdio. The binary path is taken from the `jinja-lsp.server.path` setting, defaulting to `jinja-lsp` on `PATH`. On a missing binary it surfaces a "jinja-lsp not found — install it or set jinja-lsp.server.path" notification rather than failing silently.

**REQ-EDIT-04 — Activation events.**

The extension activates `onLanguage:jinja`, `onLanguage:jinja-html`, and on opening any workspace containing a `jinja.toml`. It does not activate eagerly — an unrelated project pays no cost.

**REQ-EDIT-05 — Settings schema wraps the config keys.**

The extension contributes a `configuration` block whose properties wrap the `jinja.toml` keys one-to-one under a `jinja-lsp.*` namespace, so a user who prefers GUI settings never writes TOML. The mapping is mechanical:

| VS Code setting | `jinja.toml` key |
|---|---|
| `jinja-lsp.templates` | `templates` |
| `jinja-lsp.extensions` | `extensions` |
| `jinja-lsp.extras` | `extras` |
| `jinja-lsp.customBuiltins` | `custom_builtins` |
| `jinja-lsp.hints` | `hints` |
| `jinja-lsp.lint.select` | `lint.select` |
| `jinja-lsp.lint.ignore` | `lint.ignore` |
| `jinja-lsp.server.path` | *(client-only — the binary location)* |

These settings are forwarded as `InitializationOptions` (§5.5) on start and via `workspace/didChangeConfiguration` on change, so a workspace `jinja.toml` still overrides them per REQ-EDIT-02.

**REQ-EDIT-06 — tmLanguage syntax highlighting.**

The extension ships a `jinja.tmLanguage.json` and a language contribution registering the `jinja` / `jinja-html` languages with the usual file extensions (`.html`, `.jinja`, `.jinja2`, `.j2`). This is editor-side colorization only — it is independent of the server's semantic tokens ([F13](F13-semantic-tokens.md) layers on top of it).

### 5.3 Zed extension

A small Rust crate compiled to WASM.

**REQ-EDIT-07 — Rust extension crate registering grammar + server.**

The extension is a `zed_extension_api` crate (`crate-type = ["cdylib"]`) whose `extension.toml` declares the tree-sitter-jinja grammar and the language server. The grammar entry points at the upstream `alex-oleshkevich/tree-sitter-jinja` ([ADR-002](../decisions/ADR-002-tree-sitter-grammar.md)); the `[language_servers.jinja2-lsp]` entry names the server and its languages. The crate's `language_server_command` returns `jinja-lsp lsp` over stdio, downloading the release binary if it isn't on `PATH`. The Zed language-server id is **`jinja2-lsp`** and the language is **`Jinja2 (HTML)`**, ported verbatim from the legacy manually-created `.zed/settings.json` so existing Zed users' configuration keeps working; the binary itself remains `jinja-lsp`.

**REQ-EDIT-08 — Server registration and configuration.**

The extension registers the `jinja2-lsp` language server for the `Jinja2 (HTML)` language and forwards Zed's `lsp.jinja2-lsp.initialization_options` as the server's `InitializationOptions` (§5.5), so Zed users configure the server through `settings.json` — overlaid on any `jinja.toml` per REQ-EDIT-02.

### 5.4 Neovim — documented `nvim-lspconfig` block

Neovim needs no published plugin; a documented config block is the deliverable.

**REQ-EDIT-09 — Ship a documented `nvim-lspconfig` recipe.**

The docs provide a copy-paste Lua block that registers `jinja-lsp` with `nvim-lspconfig`: the `cmd` (`{ "jinja-lsp", "lsp" }`), the `filetypes`, a `root_dir` keyed on `jinja.toml` / `pyproject.toml` / `.git`, and an `init_options` table mirroring the config keys (§5.5). The block is shown in §6.2 and lives in the repo's README. No code to maintain beyond the snippet.

### 5.5 Generic LSP clients — the `InitializationOptions` schema

Any LSP client can configure the server with no config file by sending `InitializationOptions`.

**REQ-EDIT-10 — `InitializationOptions` mirrors `jinja.toml`.**

The `initializationOptions` object the server accepts in `initialize` has one field per config key, with the same names and types as `jinja.toml` ([E15](../foundations/E15-app-config.md)). The full shape is in §8. The server overlays these on top of the discovered config file (or the zero-config defaults), overriding the keys they set (REQ-EDIT-02, [E15](../foundations/E15-app-config.md) REQ-CFG-11); they are the universal, editor-independent configuration path. This is the same schema every integration above forwards — VS Code settings, Zed `initialization_options`, and Neovim `init_options` all serialize into this one object.

## 6. UI Mockups

### 6.1 VS Code settings panel

What a user sees in **Settings → Extensions → Jinja LSP** — the GUI wrapper over the `jinja.toml` keys (REQ-EDIT-05). Editing any field forwards it to the server.

### 6.2 Neovim `nvim-lspconfig` snippet

The copy-paste block for `init.lua` (REQ-EDIT-09). `init_options` mirrors the config keys (§5.5).

```lua
-- ~/.config/nvim/init.lua  (or a plugin module)
local lspconfig = require("lspconfig")
local configs   = require("lspconfig.configs")

if not configs.jinja_lsp then
  configs.jinja_lsp = {
    default_config = {
      cmd        = { "jinja-lsp", "lsp" },          -- stdio transport (ADR-009)
      filetypes  = { "jinja", "jinja.html", "htmldjango" },
      root_dir   = lspconfig.util.root_pattern("jinja.toml", "pyproject.toml", ".git"),
      init_options = {                              -- mirrors jinja.toml (E15)
        templates = { "templates", "..." },
        extras    = { "starlette" },
        hints     = { "hints" },
        lint      = { ignore = { "JINJA-W203" } },
      },
    },
  }
end

lspconfig.jinja_lsp.setup({})
```

States: with a workspace `jinja.toml` the `init_options` override the keys they set on top of the file (REQ-EDIT-02) · without one, `init_options` overlay the zero-config defaults.

```

## 8. Data Shapes

The `InitializationOptions` object every integration forwards and the server reads when no config file is found (REQ-EDIT-10). Field names and types mirror `jinja.toml` ([E15](../foundations/E15-app-config.md)).

```json
{
  "templates": ["templates", "..."],
  "extensions": ["html", "jinja", "jinja2", "j2"],
  "extras": ["starlette"],
  "custom_builtins": ["docs/builtins"],
  "hints": ["hints"],
  "lint": {
    "select": [],
    "ignore": ["JINJA-W203"]
  }
}
```

## 9. Examples & Use Cases

A developer on `starlette-blog` opens `templates/blog/post.html` in VS Code. The extension activates `onLanguage:jinja`, spawns `jinja-lsp lsp`, and — because the project has a `jinja.toml` with `extras = ["starlette"]` — the server resolves `request` and the post.html diagnostics light up. The same developer's teammate prefers Zed; the Zed extension launches the identical binary over stdio and they see identical findings.

A third teammate runs Neovim with no `jinja.toml`. They paste the §6.2 block, set `init_options.extras = { "starlette" }`, and the server picks up the Starlette pack through `InitializationOptions` instead of a config file — same result, different delivery (REQ-EDIT-02).

## 10. Edge Cases & Failure Modes

- **Binary not on `PATH` and no override** → VS Code shows a "not found" notification; Zed attempts to download the release binary; Neovim's `cmd` fails and `:LspInfo` reports it.
- **Both `jinja.toml` and editor settings present** → the file is the base and editor settings override the keys they set; keys they omit keep the file's values (REQ-EDIT-02).
- **Unknown `extra` in editor settings** → forwarded to the server, which reports it as a config error ([E15](../foundations/E15-app-config.md)); the integration doesn't validate config itself.
- **A slug passed in `lint.ignore` via settings** → rejected by the server (slugs aren't input — [ADR-003](../decisions/ADR-003-diagnostic-code-scheme.md)); the integration forwards it verbatim.
- **Editor requests TCP/`--http`** → unsupported; stdio is the only transport ([ADR-009](../decisions/ADR-009-stdio-only-transport.md)).

## 11. Testing

Each integration is tested at its boundary: the extensions through their client harness and a smoke launch of the binary; the documented snippets through a doc-check that the `cmd` and option keys are valid.

### 11.1 Scope & coverage

Target: **100% of this feature's behavior is covered.** Every `REQ-EDIT-NN` maps to at least one test; every surface (§6) and edge case (§10) has a test. See the policy in [E17-testing](../foundations/E17-testing.md#2-coverage-policy).

### 11.2 Test plan

Rows are grouped by editor so every integration is traced across the same three launch cases — **discovery on `PATH`**, **explicit `server.path` override**, **binary-not-found** — plus its settings→`InitializationOptions` mapping, the shared stdio-only rejection, the §10 edges, and the §6 states. "Editor" cells name the exact shim under test.

| # | Behavior / scenario | Type | Fixtures | Verifies |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Shared contract — stdio, every editor** ||||
| T-01 | Every shim's launch command is `jinja-lsp lsp` and pipes LSP over stdin/stdout — no TCP/`--http` argument is emitted by any integration | unit | — | REQ-EDIT-01 |
| T-02 | A client that requests a TCP/`--http` transport is rejected — the binary exposes no listener option and the integrations expose no such setting (ADR-009) | unit | — | REQ-EDIT-01 |
| T-03 | Config layers two ways: with a workspace `jinja.toml` present the editor's forwarded settings override the keys they set while unmentioned keys keep the file's values; without a file the forwarded `InitializationOptions` overlay the defaults (REQ-EDIT-02) | integration | starlette-blog, config-reload | REQ-EDIT-02 |
| **VS Code extension** ||||
| T-04 | Discovery on `PATH`: with `jinja-lsp.server.path` empty the client resolves `jinja-lsp` on `PATH`, spawns `jinja-lsp lsp`, and negotiates capabilities on `initialize` | integration | starlette-blog | REQ-EDIT-01, REQ-EDIT-03 |
| T-05 | Explicit override: a non-empty `jinja-lsp.server.path` is used verbatim as the binary location to spawn `jinja-lsp lsp` over stdio | unit | — | REQ-EDIT-01, REQ-EDIT-03 |
| T-06 | Binary-not-found (§6 binary-not-found state, §10): neither `PATH` nor `jinja-lsp.server.path` resolves → the "jinja-lsp not found — install it or set jinja-lsp.server.path" notification toast is shown; the client does not fail silently or crash | unit | — | REQ-EDIT-03 |
| T-07 | Activation fires `onLanguage:jinja`, `onLanguage:jinja-html`, and on opening a workspace containing `jinja.toml`; it does not activate for an unrelated project | integration | starlette-blog | REQ-EDIT-04 |
| T-08 | Settings map one-to-one onto `jinja.toml` keys (`templates`→`templates`, `extensions`→`extensions`, `extras`→`extras`, `customBuiltins`→`custom_builtins`, `hints`→`hints`, `lint.select`→`lint.select`, `lint.ignore`→`lint.ignore`; `server.path` is client-only) and serialize into the §5.5 `InitializationOptions` | unit | — | REQ-EDIT-05, REQ-EDIT-10 |
| T-09 | Settings are forwarded as `InitializationOptions` on start and re-pushed via `workspace/didChangeConfiguration` on change | unit | — | REQ-EDIT-05 |
| T-10 | §6 default state: all settings empty → no `InitializationOptions` are forced and the server uses zero-config discovery | unit | — | REQ-EDIT-05, REQ-EDIT-10 |
| T-11 | §6 workspace-has-config state: a workspace `jinja.toml` is present → the info banner renders noting forwarded settings override matching file keys (REQ-EDIT-02) | integration | starlette-blog | REQ-EDIT-02 |
| T-12 | tmLanguage: `jinja.tmLanguage.json` and the language contribution register the `jinja` / `jinja-html` languages with extensions `.html`, `.jinja`, `.jinja2`, `.j2` | unit | — | REQ-EDIT-06 |
| **Zed extension** ||||
| T-13 | `extension.toml` declares the upstream `alex-oleshkevich/tree-sitter-jinja` grammar (ADR-002) and the `[language_servers.jinja2-lsp]` server (language `Jinja2 (HTML)`) with its languages; the crate is `crate-type = ["cdylib"]` | unit | — | REQ-EDIT-07 |
| T-14 | Discovery on `PATH`: `language_server_command` returns `jinja-lsp lsp` over stdio when the binary is on `PATH` | integration | — | REQ-EDIT-07 |
| T-15 | Binary-not-found (§10, Zed path): when `jinja-lsp` is not on `PATH` the extension downloads the release binary from the GitHub release over HTTPS and verifies it against its published checksum before launching `jinja-lsp lsp` (§13.1) | unit | — | REQ-EDIT-07 |
| T-16 | Checksum mismatch: a downloaded release binary whose checksum does not match the published one is rejected and not launched | unit | — | REQ-EDIT-07 |
| T-17 | Server registration: the extension registers the `jinja2-lsp` language server for the `Jinja2 (HTML)` language (ported from the legacy `.zed/settings.json`) and forwards `lsp.jinja2-lsp.initialization_options` as the server's `InitializationOptions` (§5.5) | unit | — | REQ-EDIT-08 |
| **Neovim — documented `nvim-lspconfig` block** ||||
| T-18 | Discovery / launch: the snippet's `cmd` is `{ "jinja-lsp", "lsp" }` (stdio), `filetypes` and `root_dir` (`jinja.toml` / `pyproject.toml` / `.git`) are valid, and `init_options` keys are valid §5.5 keys | doc-check | — | REQ-EDIT-09 |
| T-19 | Binary-not-found (§10, Neovim path): with `jinja-lsp` absent the `cmd` fails to spawn and `:LspInfo` reports the failure (no override mechanism beyond editing `cmd`) | doc-check | — | REQ-EDIT-09 |
| T-20 | §6 Neovim states: without a workspace `jinja.toml` the `init_options` overlay the defaults; with one they override matching file keys while unmentioned keys keep the file's values (REQ-EDIT-02) | integration | starlette-blog, config-reload | REQ-EDIT-09, REQ-EDIT-02 |
| **Generic LSP client (incl. Helix and any stdio client)** ||||
| T-21 | `InitializationOptions` schema: the object the server accepts in `initialize` has one field per `jinja.toml` key with the same names and types (§8), and is overlaid on the config file/defaults, overriding the keys it sets (REQ-EDIT-02) | unit | — | REQ-EDIT-10 |
| T-22 | A generic stdio client (e.g. Helix, configured with `command = "jinja-lsp"`, `args = ["lsp"]`) launches the server over stdio and configures it purely through `InitializationOptions`, no config file present | integration | — | REQ-EDIT-01, REQ-EDIT-10 |
| **Shared §10 edges — forwarded verbatim, server validates** ||||
| T-23 | Unknown `extra` in editor settings is forwarded unchanged; the server reports the config error (E15); the integration does not validate config | integration | — | REQ-EDIT-05, REQ-EDIT-10 |
| T-24 | A slug passed in `lint.ignore` via settings is forwarded verbatim and rejected by the server (slugs aren't input — ADR-003); the integration does not pre-filter it | integration | — | REQ-EDIT-05, REQ-EDIT-10 |

### 11.3 Fixtures

- Reuses the `starlette-blog` workspace fixture ([E17-testing](../foundations/E17-testing.md#5-fixtures-registry)) as the project each editor opens. No integration-local fixtures.

### 11.4 Requirement coverage

## 12. End-to-End Test Plan

Each editor integration is exercised end to end by launching the real binary through its client and asserting a known diagnostic appears.

### 12.1 Coverage target

**100% of the feature's scope, end to end** — for each integration, a happy launch that yields diagnostics and the binary-not-found error path. See the policy in [E29-e2e-testing](../foundations/E29-e2e-testing.md#2-coverage-policy).

### 12.2 Scenarios

Each editor gets a happy launch (binary discovered or overridden → diagnostics) and its negative binary-not-found path, plus the stdio-only contract and the Zed download+checksum journey.

| # | Journey | Path | Expected outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| E2E-01 | Open `post.html` in VS Code on `starlette-blog`, `jinja-lsp` on `PATH` | happy | client resolves `jinja-lsp` on `PATH`, spawns `jinja-lsp lsp`, negotiates capabilities; `publishDiagnostics` arrives |
| E2E-02 | VS Code with `jinja-lsp.server.path` set to a non-`PATH` install | happy | client spawns the overridden binary over stdio; diagnostics arrive |
| E2E-03 | VS Code: `jinja-lsp` not on `PATH` and no override | error | "jinja-lsp not found — install it or set jinja-lsp.server.path" notification toast; no crash |
| E2E-04 | Open the same file in Zed, `jinja-lsp` on `PATH` | happy | identical diagnostics via the Zed extension over stdio |
| E2E-05 | Zed: `jinja-lsp` not on `PATH` | happy | extension downloads the release binary over HTTPS, verifies its published checksum, launches `jinja-lsp lsp`; diagnostics arrive |
| E2E-06 | Zed: downloaded release binary fails checksum verification | error | the binary is rejected and not launched; the server does not start |
| E2E-07 | Neovim with the documented block, `jinja-lsp` on `PATH` | happy | `:LspInfo` shows `jinja_lsp` attached; diagnostics arrive |
| E2E-08 | Neovim with the documented block, `jinja-lsp` absent | error | `cmd` fails to spawn; `:LspInfo` reports the failure; no crash |
| E2E-09 | Generic stdio client (e.g. Helix) sends `InitializationOptions`, no config file | happy | server applies them over stdio; Starlette `request` resolves |
| E2E-10 | Generic client attempts a TCP/`--http` transport | error | unsupported — the binary exposes no listener and the request is rejected; stdio remains the only transport (ADR-009) |
| E2E-11 | Workspace `jinja.toml` present while editor settings also set | happy | the file is the base; forwarded settings override the keys they set, unmentioned keys keep the file's values (REQ-EDIT-02) |

## 13. Non-Functional Requirements

### 13.1 Security & Privacy

- **Access & authorization** — integrations launch a local subprocess over stdio; the trust boundary is the developer's machine. No network listener is ever opened ([ADR-009](../decisions/ADR-009-stdio-only-transport.md)).
- **Input & validation** — editor settings are forwarded to the server as-is; the server validates them ([E15](../foundations/E15-app-config.md)). The binary-path setting is the one client-side input and is used only to spawn the process.
- **Data sensitivity** — nothing leaves the machine; the server has no network access. A downloaded Zed release binary is fetched from the GitHub release ([F21](F21-release-ci.md)) over HTTPS and verified against its published checksum.

### 13.4 Performance & Scale

- **Latency** — integrations add no analysis cost; perceived latency is the server's (completions < 100 ms, index < 2 s / 500 templates — P6). Activation is lazy (REQ-EDIT-04) so unrelated projects pay nothing.

## 15. Open Questions & Decisions

- **Decided** — stdio is the only transport every integration uses ([ADR-009](../decisions/ADR-009-stdio-only-transport.md)).
- **Decided** — the Zed extension is a `zed_extension_api` crate declaring the upstream grammar and the language server ([ADR-002](../decisions/ADR-002-tree-sitter-grammar.md)).
- **OQ-EDIT-1** — whether to publish a standalone Neovim plugin later, or keep the documented block only (currently: documented block only).

## 16. Cross-References

- **Depends on:** [constitution](../constitution.md) — P2/P5 and the visualization rule; [E01-architecture](../foundations/E01-architecture.md) — capabilities and stdio transport; [E15-app-config](../foundations/E15-app-config.md) — the config keys these settings mirror.
- **Related:** [F21-release-ci](F21-release-ci.md) — building and publishing the extensions and binaries; [E03-tech-stack](../foundations/E03-tech-stack.md) — the upstream grammar and `zed_extension_api`.

## 17. Changelog

- **2026-06-24** — Initial draft.
- **2026-06-25** — Expanded §11.2 test plan and §12.2 e2e scenarios to full combination coverage: each editor (VS Code, Zed, Neovim, generic/Helix) × {PATH discovery, `server.path` override, binary-not-found} happy + negative, the stdio-only/TCP-rejection contract (ADR-009), the Zed grammar + release-binary download + checksum (and mismatch) path, settings→`InitializationOptions` mapping with `didChangeConfiguration`, capability negotiation, and every §6 state and §10 edge. Rebuilt §11.4 so every REQ-EDIT maps to its concrete test IDs.
- **2026-06-26** — **Config-precedence flip + legacy Zed port.** Reconciled the precedence with [E15](../foundations/E15-app-config.md) REQ-CFG-11 and the legacy server: the config file (or zero-config defaults) is now the **base** and `InitializationOptions` are an **overlay that overrides per-key** — previously the spec said the file wins and options are ignored when a file exists. Updated REQ-EDIT-02/EDIT-10, §1, the §6.1 VS Code banner + states, §6.2 Neovim states, §10, and T-03/T-11/T-20/T-21/E2E-11 accordingly. Ported the legacy manually-created `.zed/settings.json` identifiers into the Zed extension (REQ-EDIT-07/08, T-13/T-17): language-server id **`jinja2-lsp`**, language **`Jinja2 (HTML)`**, settings key `lsp.jinja2-lsp.initialization_options` — the binary stays `jinja-lsp`. Note: the Zed server id now differs from VS Code's `jinja-lsp`; unify if a suite-wide rename is desired.
