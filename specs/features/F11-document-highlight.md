# F11 — Document Highlight

> **Status:** Approved
>
> **Version:** 0.3   ·   **Last updated:** 2026-06-26
>
> **Purpose:** When the cursor rests on a Jinja symbol, highlight every occurrence of it in the current file — distinguishing the write (definition) from the reads (usages). The file-local, automatic counterpart to find-references.

> **Depends on:** [constitution](../constitution.md), [E07-data-model](../foundations/E07-data-model.md), [E01-architecture](../foundations/E01-architecture.md)   ·   **Related:** [F09-find-references](F09-find-references.md), [F08-go-to-definition](F08-go-to-definition.md), [F10-symbols](F10-symbols.md)

## 1. Purpose & Scope

Rest your cursor on a variable name and every other place it appears in the same file lights up — softly, automatically, no command needed. That's document highlight: the editor's quiet way of showing you "here's everywhere this thing is used right here." It's the file-local sibling of [F09](F09-find-references.md), which spans the whole workspace on demand.

This spec defines `textDocument/documentHighlight`: which symbols highlight, how occurrences are found within the one file, and how a definition is marked as a *write* versus a usage as a *read*.

This spec covers:

- The symbols that highlight: variables, macros, blocks, imports.
- File-local occurrence collection from the existing `Reference` data.
- The write (definition) vs read (usage) highlight kinds.

## 2. Non-Goals / Out of Scope

- Workspace-wide reference search — [F09-find-references](F09-find-references.md). Document highlight never leaves the current file.
- Jumping to a definition — [F08-go-to-definition](F08-go-to-definition.md).
- The outline of the file — [F10-symbols](F10-symbols.md).

## 3. Background & Rationale

Document highlight reuses data that already exists. Pass 1 extracts a `Reference` for every usage site and a definition for every macro, block, variable, and import in the file ([E07](../foundations/E07-data-model.md)). Highlighting is a pure read of that one `TemplateIndex` ([E01](../foundations/E01-architecture.md) REQ-ARCH-07): resolve the symbol under the cursor to its binding, collect that binding's same-file occurrences, tag each as read or write.

It resolves variables the same way every navigation feature does — via E07's reference resolution ([E07](../foundations/E07-data-model.md) REQ-DATA-11), which maps a use to the `VariableDefinition` whose `valid_range` contains it, innermost binding winning. That is exactly what keeps an inner `{% for post %}` from cross-highlighting an outer `post`: the two are distinct bindings with distinct `valid_range`s, and F11 highlights only the occurrences of the binding the cursor resolves to, within that binding's `valid_range`. For attribute / filter / call references, only the **head identifier** range is an occurrence (`post` in `post.title`, never the `.title` member).

Because it's file-local, it doesn't need Pass 2's cross-template resolution — which is what makes it cheap enough to run on every cursor move. Where [F09](F09-find-references.md) walks the whole `WorkspaceIndex`, F11 walks one file's facts, but resolves them through the same REQ-DATA-11 mechanism F09 uses.

## 4. Concepts & Definitions

- **Highlight kind** — the LSP `DocumentHighlightKind`. F11 produces only two of its three variants: `Write` for a definition / binding / re-assignment, `Read` for a usage. The third variant, `Text`, is never produced — every Jinja occurrence F11 collects is either a binding or a use, so it always carries a meaningful Write/Read kind.
- **Occurrence** — one appearance of a symbol's name in the current file.
- **Reference** — a usage site. (Canonical definition in [glossary](../glossary.md).)

## 5. Detailed Specification

### 5.1 What highlights

Document highlight covers more than find-references does, because *within one file* even a local variable's occurrences are worth showing.

**REQ-HL-01 — Highlight variables, macros, blocks, and imports.**

When the cursor rests on the name of a variable (`{% set %}` target, `{% for %}` loop target — including each target of a `{% for k, v in … %}` tuple-unpack — the `loop` special variable, `{% with %}` binding, macro parameter), a macro, a block, or an import alias, collect every occurrence of that name in the **current file** and return a `DocumentHighlight[]`. Variables are resolved through E07's reference resolution ([E07](../foundations/E07-data-model.md) REQ-DATA-11): the cursor's reference resolves to its binding, and only that binding's occurrences within its `valid_range` ([E07](../foundations/E07-data-model.md) REQ-DATA-03) highlight. For an attribute / filter / call reference, the occurrence is the **head identifier** range only (`post` in `post.title`, not `.title`). Unlike [F09](F09-find-references.md), local variables *do* highlight here — the scope is one file, so there's no risk of stepping on the host LSP across the workspace.

The `loop` special variable is itself a `ForLoop`-scope binding ([E07](../foundations/E07-data-model.md) REQ-DATA-07): resting on `loop` (in `{{ loop.index }}`, `{{ loop.first }}`) highlights its uses within the enclosing `{% for %}` body. A `{% for k, v in … %}` introduces two separate `ForLoop` bindings, `k` and `v`; the cursor resolves to whichever target it rests on, and only that target's uses highlight.

### 5.2 File-local collection

Occurrences come from the file's own extracted facts, never from re-scanning text.

**REQ-HL-02 — Collect occurrences from the current `TemplateIndex` only.**

Occurrences are every `Reference` that resolves to the symbol within the same file, plus the binding itself **only when the binding lives in this file** ([E07](../foundations/E07-data-model.md) REQ-DATA-11). When the binding lives elsewhere (an imported macro defined in another file) or nowhere template-owned (a host-injected variable), no in-file binding occurrence exists and the result is reads-only — see REQ-HL-03 and REQ-HL-04. Collection never crosses into other files — that's [F09](F09-find-references.md)'s job. Each occurrence is a range at the symbol's name (for an attribute / filter / call reference, the head-identifier range only). A variable reference resolves to the `VariableDefinition` whose `valid_range` ([E07](../foundations/E07-data-model.md) REQ-DATA-03) contains it, innermost binding winning ([E07](../foundations/E07-data-model.md) REQ-DATA-11) — so an inner `{% for post %}` binding and an outer `post` are distinct symbols, and F11 highlights only the occurrences inside the resolved binding's `valid_range`. This is the mechanism that keeps the inner `post` from cross-highlighting the outer one.

### 5.3 Write vs read kinds

Marking the definition differently from its usages helps the eye find "where this starts."

**REQ-HL-03 — Mark bindings/re-assignments `Write`, usages `Read`.**

The kind is assigned per occurrence, by what the occurrence *does* to the symbol:

- a **definition / binding** — the `{% macro %}` / `{% block %}` / `{% set %}` / `{% for %}` target / `{% with %}` binding / macro-parameter name — is `kind = Write`;
- a **usage** (a read of the value) is `kind = Read`;
- a **child block that overrides a parent block** — it re-defines the block — is `kind = Write` (a re-definition, not a read). Because F11 is file-local, this only applies when both blocks live in the **same file** (rare — block override normally spans the child→parent template boundary, which is [F09](F09-find-references.md)'s domain). The optional `{% endblock name %}` name echo, when present, is **not** a separate highlightable occurrence — only the opening `{% block name %}` name range is collected;
- **each `{% set x = … %}` re-assignment** of the same name is `kind = Write` (every re-assign writes);
- a **local `from … import` binding** (the name introduced by `{% from "…" import name %}`) is `kind = Write` — it binds the name locally;
- the **head of an attribute access** (`post` in `{{ post.title }}`) is `kind = Read` — reading the receiver.

When no binding exists in the file (an imported macro *used* but defined elsewhere), all occurrences are `Read`. Editors typically tint writes and reads differently, so this distinction is visible.

### 5.4 Negative behavior

Document highlight stays as quiet as it is helpful.

**REQ-HL-04 — Non-symbol and host-owned positions return nothing.**

When the cursor isn't on a highlightable Jinja symbol — in host-language text, on a delimiter, on whitespace — return an empty result, never an error. An unrecognized position simply produces no highlights.

A cursor on a **host-injected / un-hinted context variable** (`{{ request }}`, an un-hinted `{{ post }}`) also returns an empty result. Such a reference resolves to no template-owned binding ([E07](../foundations/E07-data-model.md) REQ-DATA-11), consistent with find-references' negative contract ([F09](F09-find-references.md) REQ-REF-04): the symbol is host-owned, so returning nothing lets the host language LSP's own document-highlight win.

## 6. UI Mockups

### 6.1 A variable highlighted across the file

The cursor rests on `post` inside the loop body; the loop variable's binding (the `{% for %}` target) is boxed as a write, and each read — the head identifier only, so `post` in `post.title`, not `.title` — is underlined. The host-injected `request` is untouched: it's host-owned, so resting on it would yield nothing (REQ-HL-04) and the host LSP would highlight it instead.

```
┌─ templates/email/digest.html ────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1 │ {% for post in request.state.posts %}                                │
│    │         ▓▓▓▓  ◄── write (loop variable defined here)                  │
│  2 │   <h2>{{ post.title }}</h2>                                          │
│    │          ‾‾‾‾  ◄── read                                              │
│  3 │   <p>{{ post.body | truncate(40) }}</p>                             │
│    │         ‾‾‾‾  ◄── read                                               │
│  4 │   <a href="{{ post_url(post) }}">more</a>                           │
│    │                       ‾‾‾‾  ◄── read                                 │
│  5 │ {% endfor %}                                                         │
│                                                                            │
│  ▓ write (definition)    ‾ read (usage)                                    │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

States: active highlight (write + reads shown) · no-result (cursor off-symbol, §6.3).

### 6.2 A macro highlighted (definition + call)

Resting on `excerpt` boxes the `{% macro %}` name and underlines its one call.

```
  1 │ {% macro excerpt(post, words) %}{{ post.body }}{% endmacro %}
  2 │ {{ excerpt(post, 40) }}
       ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ (write)        ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾ (read)
```

States: active highlight (write + read shown) · no-result (cursor off-symbol, §6.3).

### 6.3 No-result (cursor off a highlightable symbol)

The cursor sits on host text, a delimiter, whitespace, or a host-owned variable (`request`); nothing lights up and the host LSP's own highlight wins (REQ-HL-04).

```
  1 │ {% for post in request.state.posts %}
                     ▏  ◄── cursor on host-owned `request` → no Jinja highlight
  2 │   <h2>Latest</h2>
          ▏  ◄── cursor on host text → no highlight
```

States: no-result only (empty `DocumentHighlight[]`, no error).

## 8. Data Shapes

`textDocument/documentHighlight` returns a `DocumentHighlight[]`. Each element is a `{ range, kind }` where `kind` is the LSP `DocumentHighlightKind` enum — `Text = 1`, `Read = 2`, `Write = 3`. F11 emits only `Read` and `Write`, never `Text` (§4). The response for the `post` loop variable in §6.1:

```json
[
  { "range": { "start": {"line": 0, "character": 8},  "end": {"line": 0, "character": 12} }, "kind": 3 },
  { "range": { "start": {"line": 1, "character": 9},  "end": {"line": 1, "character": 13} }, "kind": 2 },
  { "range": { "start": {"line": 2, "character": 8},  "end": {"line": 2, "character": 12} }, "kind": 2 },
  { "range": { "start": {"line": 3, "character": 24}, "end": {"line": 3, "character": 28} }, "kind": 2 }
]
```

A no-result position (REQ-HL-04) returns an empty array `[]`.

## 9. Examples & Use Cases

Editing `templates/email/digest.html` in `starlette-blog`, you rest the cursor on the `post` loop variable. Its definition in `{% for post in … %}` highlights as a write; each `post.title`, `post.body`, and `post_url(post)` in the loop highlights as a read (§5.1, §5.3). The unrelated `request` global stays dark. Resting on `post_url` (imported, defined elsewhere) highlights only its call site as a read, since the definition isn't in this file (§5.3).

## 10. Edge Cases & Failure Modes

- **Two variables sharing a name in different scopes** → only the occurrences in the cursor's scope highlight; the other scope's `post` is a distinct symbol (§5.2).
- **Imported macro used but not defined locally** → all occurrences are `Read`; no `Write` in this file (§5.3).
- **Cursor on host-language text** → empty result (§5.4).
- **A symbol used once and never else** → a single highlight (its definition or its sole usage).
- **Broken template** → highlight whatever Pass 1 extracted; missing occurrences are simply absent (P3).
- **Inline templates** ([E31](../foundations/E31-inline-templates.md)) → highlights stay within the inline region, in host-file coordinates.

## 11. Testing

Document highlight is verified by integration tests over the `starlette-blog` fixture plus a `pytest-lsp` protocol journey.

### 11.1 Scope & coverage

Target: **100% of this spec's behavior.** Every `REQ-HL-NN` maps to at least one test. See [E17-testing](../foundations/E17-testing.md#2-coverage-policy).

### 11.2 Test plan

Each row is a concrete cursor position over a named construct, with the exact expected highlight set. "Synthetic doc" = an in-memory `didOpen` document for a construct not present in the `starlette-blog` baseline ([E17 §5](../foundations/E17-testing.md#starlette-blog)).

| # | Construct / cursor · fixture | Type | Expected outcome | Verifies |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **REQ-HL-01 — which symbols highlight** | | | | |
| 1 | Cursor on `post` loop variable in `{% for post … %}` · `email/digest.html` | integration | a `DocumentHighlight[]` covering the `for` target + each in-loop `post` | REQ-HL-01 |
| 2 | Cursor on `{% set %}` target name · synthetic doc (`{% set total = 0 %}…{{ total }}`) | integration | highlights at the `set` target + each `total` read | REQ-HL-01 |
| 3 | Cursor on a macro parameter inside its body · synthetic doc (`{% macro m(words) %}{{ words }}{% endmacro %}`) | integration | highlights at the parameter decl + each `words` use in the body | REQ-HL-01 |
| 4 | Cursor on a locally-defined macro name `post_url` · `blog/macros.html` | integration | highlights at the `{% macro %}` name + any same-file call | REQ-HL-01 |
| 5 | Cursor on a block name `content` · `base.html` | integration | highlights at the `{% block content %}` opening name only; the `{% endblock content %}` name echo is **not** a separate occurrence; same-file override would add a `Write` (§5.3) | REQ-HL-01 |
| 6 | Cursor on an import alias `y` · synthetic doc (`{% import "x" as y %}{{ y.z }}`) | integration | highlights at the alias slot + each `y` use | REQ-HL-01 |
| 6a | Cursor on the `loop` special var · synthetic doc (`{% for x in xs %}{{ loop.index }}{{ loop.first }}{% endfor %}`) | integration | highlights at each `loop` head only (`loop`, not `.index`/`.first`) within the loop body | REQ-HL-01 |
| 6b | Cursor on one target of a tuple-unpack `{% for k, v in items %}{{ k }}:{{ v }}{% endfor %}` · synthetic doc | integration | only that target's uses highlight (`k` highlights `k`, leaves `v` dark; `Write` on its `for` slot) | REQ-HL-01 |
| 6c | Cursor on `post` in an attribute access `{{ post.title }}` (loop var) · `email/digest.html` | integration | only the head identifier `post` highlights; `.title` is never part of an occurrence | REQ-HL-01 |
| **REQ-HL-02 — file-local, scope-aware collection** | | | | |
| 7 | Cursor on `post_url` call in `blog/post.html` (defined in `blog/macros.html`) | integration | only the same-file occurrence highlights; the def in `macros.html` is **not** included | REQ-HL-02 |
| 8 | Cursor on inner-scope `post` loop var when an outer `post` of the same name exists · synthetic doc (`{% for post in xs %}{{ post }}{% endfor %}{{ post }}`) | integration | only the in-loop occurrences highlight; the outer-scope `post` stays dark (distinct symbol) | REQ-HL-02 |
| 9 | Cursor on `post` in `email/digest.html` loop; unrelated `request` global present | integration | `post` occurrences highlight; `request` is untouched (§6.1) | REQ-HL-02 |
| **REQ-HL-03 — write vs read kinds** | | | | |
| 10 | Cursor on the `for` target `post` · `email/digest.html` | integration | the `for` target is `kind = Write`; every in-loop `post` is `kind = Read` (§6.1) | REQ-HL-03 |
| 11 | Cursor on a locally-defined macro `m` with one call · synthetic doc | integration | the `{% macro %}` name is `Write`; the call is `Read` (§6.2) | REQ-HL-03 |
| 12 | Cursor on imported macro `post_url`'s call · `email/digest.html` (def lives in `blog/macros.html`) | integration | all occurrences are `Read`; no `Write` in this file | REQ-HL-03 |
| 13 | Cursor on a symbol with a single occurrence: a never-read `{% set x = 1 %}` · synthetic doc | integration | one highlight, `kind = Write` (the lone definition) | REQ-HL-03 |
| 14 | Cursor on a symbol used exactly once with no local def (imported, single call) · synthetic doc | integration | one highlight, `kind = Read` (the sole usage) | REQ-HL-03 |
| 14a | Cursor on a child block that overrides a parent block · `email/digest.html` (`{% block content %}` override) | integration | the override `{% block %}` name is `kind = Write` (a re-definition) | REQ-HL-03 |
| 14b | Cursor on a name re-assigned by a second `{% set %}` · synthetic doc (`{% set x = 1 %}{{ x }}{% set x = 2 %}{{ x }}`) | integration | each `{% set %}` target is `kind = Write`; each `{{ x }}` is `kind = Read` | REQ-HL-03 |
| 14c | Cursor on a `from … import` binding · synthetic doc (`{% from "x" import f %}{{ f() }}`) | integration | the imported-name binding slot is `kind = Write`; the call is `kind = Read` | REQ-HL-03 |
| 14d | Cursor on the head of an attribute access `{{ post.title }}` (loop var `post`) · `email/digest.html` | integration | the head `post` occurrence is `kind = Read` (reading the receiver) | REQ-HL-03 |
| **REQ-HL-04 — non-symbol & host-owned positions** | | | | |
| 15 | Cursor on host-language HTML text (e.g. `<h2>`) · `email/digest.html` | integration | empty result, no error | REQ-HL-04 |
| 16 | Cursor on a delimiter (`{{`, `{%`) · synthetic doc | integration | empty result, no error | REQ-HL-04 |
| 17 | Cursor on whitespace inside an expression · synthetic doc | integration | empty result, no error | REQ-HL-04 |
| 17a | Cursor on a host-injected context variable `request` (`{{ request }}`) · `email/digest.html` | integration | empty result; host-owned, resolves to no template binding (REQ-DATA-11, F09 REQ-REF-04), host LSP highlight wins | REQ-HL-04 |
| 17b | Cursor on an un-hinted `{{ post }}` with no template binding · synthetic doc | integration | empty result; host-owned, no highlights | REQ-HL-04 |
| **§10 edges** | | | | |
| 18 | Cursor on a symbol in a broken template (unclosed tag) where Pass 1 extracted only some occurrences · `syntax-errors` | integration | highlights whatever Pass 1 extracted; missing occurrences simply absent, no error (P3) | REQ-HL-02 |
| 19 | Cursor on a symbol inside an inline/embedded template region · `call-and-paths` ([E31](../foundations/E31-inline-templates.md)) | integration | highlights stay within the inline region, returned in host-file coordinates | REQ-HL-02 |

### 11.3 Fixtures

- `starlette-blog`, reusing `email/digest.html` for the loop-variable case, `blog/macros.html` for the locally-defined macro, `blog/post.html` for the cross-file import call, and `base.html` for the block. Registered in [E17-testing](../foundations/E17-testing.md#5-fixtures-registry).
- `syntax-errors` for the broken-template edge (row 18) and `call-and-paths` for the inline/embedded edge (row 19), both registered in [E17-testing](../foundations/E17-testing.md#5-fixtures-registry).
- Synthetic in-memory `didOpen` documents for constructs absent from the baseline: `{% set %}` target (incl. re-assignment), macro parameter, `{% import … as %}` alias, `{% from … import %}` binding, the `loop` special var, `{% for k, v in … %}` tuple-unpack targets, single-occurrence symbols, an un-hinted host variable, and delimiter/whitespace cursor positions (per [E17 §5](../foundations/E17-testing.md#starlette-blog)).

### 11.4 Requirement coverage

| Requirement | Covered by |
|---|---|
| REQ-HL-01 | rows 1–6, 6a–6c — loop var, `set` target, macro param, local macro, block, import alias, `loop` special var, tuple-unpack target, attribute head identifier |
| REQ-HL-02 | rows 7–9, 18, 19 — file-local only, scope-aware (`valid_range`/REQ-DATA-11), broken-template, inline |
| REQ-HL-03 | rows 10–14, 14a–14d — write/read kinds, imported-elsewhere all-`Read`, single-occurrence write & read, override-block `Write`, `set` re-assignment `Write`, `from`-import binding `Write`, attribute head `Read` |
| REQ-HL-04 | rows 15–17, 17a–17b — host text, delimiter, whitespace, host-injected/un-hinted variable |

## 12. End-to-End Test Plan

### 12.1 Coverage target

**100% of highlight collection and the write/read distinction**, via `pytest-lsp` against the real stdio binary ([E29-e2e-testing](../foundations/E29-e2e-testing.md), Branch B).

### 12.2 Scenarios

| # | Journey | Path | Expected outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| E2E-01 | Cursor on a loop variable (`post` in `email/digest.html`) | happy | `Write` on the `for` target, `Read` on each in-loop usage |
| E2E-02 | Cursor on a `{% set %}` target (synthetic doc) | happy | `Write` on the `set` target, `Read` on each subsequent use |
| E2E-03 | Cursor on a locally-defined macro (`post_url` in `blog/macros.html`) | happy | `Write` on the `{% macro %}` name, `Read` on its same-file call |
| E2E-04 | Cursor on a block name (`content` in `base.html`) | happy | `Write` on the `{% block %}` name; only same-file occurrences |
| E2E-05 | Cursor on an import alias (synthetic `{% import "x" as y %}`) | happy | `Write` on the alias slot, `Read` on each `y` use |
| E2E-06 | Cursor on an imported macro's call (`post_url` in `email/digest.html`, defined elsewhere) | happy | all occurrences `Read`, no `Write` |
| E2E-07 | Cursor on an inner-scope `post` while an outer `post` exists (synthetic doc) | happy | only the in-loop occurrences highlight; the outer `post` stays dark (resolved via `valid_range`/REQ-DATA-11) |
| E2E-08 | Cursor on a single-occurrence definition (`{% set x = 1 %}`, never read) | happy | one highlight, `kind = Write` |
| E2E-08b | Cursor on the `loop` special var (`{{ loop.index }}` in a `{% for %}` body, synthetic doc) | happy | each `loop` head highlights within the loop body; `.index`/`.first` members excluded |
| E2E-08c | Cursor on one target of a tuple-unpack `{% for k, v in items %}` (synthetic doc) | happy | only that target's uses highlight; the sibling target stays dark |
| E2E-09 | Cursor on host-language HTML text | negative | empty result, no error |
| E2E-10 | Cursor on a delimiter (`{{` / `{%`) | negative | empty result, no error |
| E2E-11 | Cursor on whitespace inside an expression | negative | empty result, no error |
| E2E-11b | Cursor on a host-injected context variable (`{{ request }}`) | negative | empty result, no error; host LSP highlight wins (REQ-DATA-11, F09 REQ-REF-04) |
| E2E-12 | Cursor on a symbol in a broken template (`syntax-errors`) | negative | highlights only what Pass 1 extracted; no error (P3) |

## 13. Non-Functional Requirements

### 13.1 Security & Privacy

- **Access & authorization** — a read-only LSP handler over stdio; single-user; no host execution. Trust boundary = the open file and the workspace index.
- **Input & validation** — all template content is untrusted; highlights read the index only and never execute templates (P1).
- **Data sensitivity** — ranges point only into the open file; nothing leaves the machine.
- **Baseline** — meets OWASP ASVS L1; STRIDE: the only untrusted input is template text, handled by static parse (P1).

### 13.2 Accessibility

- **N/A** — no GUI; the editor renders the highlight tints.

### 13.4 Performance & Scale

- **Latency** — highlight runs on every cursor move, so it must be fast; reading one `TemplateIndex` keeps it well under the 100 ms budget (P6).

### 13.5 Observability

- **Logs / traces** — inherits the lightweight `tracing` baseline ([E16](../foundations/E16-conventions.md)); as a hot path (highlight runs on every cursor move), only slow resolutions emit a span — no dedicated metrics.

## 16. Cross-References

- **Depends on:** [constitution](../constitution.md) — P1, P3, P6; [E07-data-model](../foundations/E07-data-model.md) — the `Reference` data reused, `valid_range` (REQ-DATA-03), and reference resolution (REQ-DATA-11) that scopes each binding; [E01-architecture](../foundations/E01-architecture.md) — pure-read handlers.
- **Related:** [F09-find-references](F09-find-references.md) — the workspace-wide counterpart, sharing the same reference data and the same host-owned negative contract (REQ-REF-04); [F08-go-to-definition](F08-go-to-definition.md) — jumping to the write; [F10-symbols](F10-symbols.md) — the file's symbols as an outline.

## 17. Changelog
- **2026-06-26** — Status: Draft → Approved.

- **2026-06-24** — Initial draft.
- **2026-06-25** — Expanded §11.2 to 19 concrete rows and §12.2 to 12 E2E scenarios for full combinatorial coverage (Write/Read kinds; loop var / set target / macro param / local macro / block / import alias; defined-in-file vs imported-elsewhere; scope-distinct names; single-occurrence write & read; host-text / delimiter / whitespace negatives; broken-template and inline §10 edges). Rebuilt §11.4 as a one-row-per-REQ bijection.
- **2026-06-26** — v0.3: spec-review fixes. Clarified REQ-HL-02 that the binding occurrence is included only when the binding lives in this file; otherwise occurrences are reads-only (jinja-lsp-1hy). Stated block-override `Write` applies same-file only and that the `{% endblock name %}` echo is not a separate occurrence (§5.3, row 5) (jinja-lsp-p46). Added a "States:" line to each §6 mockup plus a §6.3 no-result (cursor off-symbol) mockup (jinja-lsp-cuq). Added §8 Data Shapes pinning `DocumentHighlight{range, kind}` and the enum `Text=1`/`Read=2`/`Write=3` (jinja-lsp-ydv). Added a §13.5 Observability note inheriting E16's lightweight tracing on the hot path (jinja-lsp-d2u). Added the required §13.1 "Access & authorization" and "Baseline (OWASP ASVS L1 / STRIDE)" bullets (jinja-lsp-9ix).
- **2026-06-25** — v0.2: grounded scope disambiguation in E07's `valid_range` (REQ-DATA-03) + reference resolution (REQ-DATA-11) — F11 now resolves the cursor's reference to its binding and highlights only that binding's occurrences within its `valid_range` (§3, §5.1, §5.2). Stated attribute/filter/call references highlight only the head identifier. Made REQ-HL-03 explicit per kind (binding/override/`set`-reassign/`from`-import → `Write`; usage/attribute-head → `Read`). Added `loop` special var + `{% for k, v %}` tuple-unpack handling (§5.1) with test rows 6a–6c / 14a–14d / 17a–17b and E2E-08b/08c/11b. Added the host-injected/un-hinted variable negative to REQ-HL-04 (consistent with F09 REQ-REF-04). Removed the never-produced `Text` kind from §4. Refreshed the §11.4 REQ↔rows bijection and the §6.1 mockup caption.
